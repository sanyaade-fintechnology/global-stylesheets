Global Stylesheets
=================

This repo contains SASS partials, which can be seen as the "SumUp-Bootstrap". Include these files in a new web project and you'll already get nice buttons, forms, lists, etc... 

And of course: Everything about the Corporate Design is always updated and managed in one place.
